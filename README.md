# Sourdough Starter
You've probably landed here because you received some sourdough starter, possibly from me! ;)
Unless the starter is *very* fresh, you will probably need to feed or refresh it before you can use it.
Besides, if you go ahead and use up your starter, you won't have any more to use later on.

Your starter will keep for a few months in the refrigerator.
If you won't be using it within a week of receiving it, go ahead and pop it in the coldbox.
*Set a reminder* on your calendar (or wherever you'll see it in ~2 months) to feed/refresh your starter.
The more often you refresh it, the better it will get over time!
